# Next.js Dashboard

This project was created out of curiosity and follows the Next.js dashboard application's [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Notes

Unable to start the course with npm due to dependency conflicts. The only way to get started was to use pnpm.
This is my first time ever using it. I don't understand why it doesn't work with npm. The only thing I know about
pnpm is that there are packages out there that require pnpm people to do all sorts of workarounds. Other than that,
pnpm seems to be widely enjoyed.
